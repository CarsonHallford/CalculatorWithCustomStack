# Instructions  
 
The purpose of this exercise is to build a custom stack, and use it in the previous Calculator exercise to prove that it works.

The input, output, and tests are identical to the previous Calculator exercise.

Implement your own `Stack` class with `push()`, `pop()`, and `top()` methods. Test it to make sure it works, then copy-paste your previous solution to the Calculator exercise to pass the tests.
